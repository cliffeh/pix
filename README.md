*# pix
a collection of fun lil rpi things

I built a little 4-node Raspberry Pi cluster to play around with for funsies. This repo has some scripts and things I've built along the way.

Maybe take a peek at some of the other READMEs, which I'll try to create along the way.

* [bin/README.md](bin/README.md) - Scripts
* [blink/README.md](blink/README.md) - Playing around with the [Blinkt!](http://docs.pimoroni.com/blinkt/) Python library
